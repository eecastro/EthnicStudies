# March Summer Reading Storyboard
Having read books One, Two, and Three of John Lewis's *March*, you will create a storyboard of pivotal moments in Lewis’ life as told through his graphic novels.  

# Guiding Questions: 
* What experiences and turning points in John Lewis’ life influenced his choices and his trajectory?
* In what ways did his identity (consider focusing on 1-2 aspects) shape how he was seen/treated and how responded?
* What theme(s) connect the different events of experiences in Lewis’ life?

You should focus on one theme or aspect of the story that carries through each of the three books. You will choose ONE scene from EACH book as an example of your theme or aspect to respond to one or both of the guiding questions.

Use Google Slides to create your storyboard. Make a copy of the template. (1 per group)

## From book One
Choose an event from John Lewis’ childhood that fits your theme/response to the questions
Include an image from the book on this scene (with page number)
Write a 2-3 sentence summary of this scene (including quotes is okay in addition to 2-3 sentences)

## From book Two
Choose an event from John Lewis’ involvement in the Civil Rights Movement in Book 2 that ties to the theme/response to the questions 
Include an image from the book on this scene (with page number)
Write a 2-3 sentence summary of this scene (including quotes is okay in addition to 2-3 sentences)
From book Three
